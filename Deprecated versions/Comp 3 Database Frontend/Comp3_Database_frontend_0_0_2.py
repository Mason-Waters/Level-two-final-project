    Desc: Database frontend, handles display and whatnot
    Version: 0.0.2
    Improvements over previous version:
        The previous version was just too buggy to work with, and had support
        for sql injection. This implementation is better.
        Filter is consolodated into one dictionary, as opposed to three
        Added support for order by
        Progress toward display of data
    Disadvantages
        This works fine! If you have over a gigabyte of ram dedicated and are
        prepared to constantly restart your program. Which I do not, and am not
        It is also quite messy.
