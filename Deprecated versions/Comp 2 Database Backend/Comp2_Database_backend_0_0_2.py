    Desc: Database backend
    Version: 0.0 (Trial number two)
    Improvements over previous trials:
        Login function no longer has to be iterated over
        Login function now supports multiple attempts at logging in (Ie: in case of typos)
        Account creation now requires double entry of username and password (Ie: in case of typos)
    Disadvantages over previous trials:
        No error code mechanic in login function
        Making an account is now subtly more tedious
